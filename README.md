Plateforme de partage d'exp√©riences sur le soin de pathologies

### Abstract
This report presents our year-end project, designed to deepen and apply our skills in soft-
ware development. We used web scraping and automation techniques with Python to extract
care experiences from various websites, and the Llama model to classify these experiences to
facilitate information access. The objective is to create a platform that allows users to share
and search for experiences related to pathologies.
We first defined the problem, needs, and objectives, then studied the system architecture.
The application development began with the programming of web scraping scripts to extract
relevant data online. Next, we designed and programmed the user interfaces to facilitate navi-
gation and information search.
A data management system was implemented to store the collected experiences. Rigorous
tests were conducted at each stage to ensure the application functions correctly. This project,
developed in Python and Java with various frameworks and libraries, allowed us to strengthen
our technical skills and create a valuable resource for those seeking information on care for
pathologies.
